        <h2>Favorite quote</h2>
        <p><i><b>Frodo:</b> [of Gollum] It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance.</p>
        <p><b>Gandalf:</b> Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death. Some that die
            deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo? Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the
            very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill
            before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.</i></p>
